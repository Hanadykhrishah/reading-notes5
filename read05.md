# Operators:
___

 ### JavaScript has the following types of operators
- Assignment operators.
- Comparison operators.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Logical operators.
- Unary operators.
-  Conditional (ternary) operator.
___
### Assignment operators:

| Name |Shorthand operator |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Assignment | x = y |
| Addition assignment | 	x += y |
|Subtraction assignment | x -= y |
|Multiplication assignment | x *= y |
|Division assignment | x /= y |
| Remainder assignment | x %= y |

#### Comparison operators

```
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons

# Loops:
#### Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

1. ** for statement.**

2. ** while statement.**
___
## for statement:

```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement.

```
## while statement:
```

while (condition)
  statement
```
